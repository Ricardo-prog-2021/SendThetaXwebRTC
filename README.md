# SendThetaXwebRTC
Unidirectional transmission from sender to receiver of Ricoh ThetaX camera



WebRTC + Ricoh ThetaX camera test. This version only sends the video from the transmitter to the receiver. The receiver does not send back video.

Used code from: https://github.com/fireship-io/webrtc-firebase-demo
